# Python Programs

This repository contains two simple Python programs:

-   **Task 1.py** -- Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers entered by the
    user.
-   **Task 2.py** -- Asks for the user's first and last name, then
    displays a welcome message.
